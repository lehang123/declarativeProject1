-- how many cards in the guess are correct (done)

-- how many cards in the answer have rank lower than the lowest rank in the guess.(done)
    -- Ranks, in order from low to high, are 2â€“10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace.

-- How many of the cards in the answer have the same rank as a card in the guess (correct ranks).
    --  For this, each card in the guess is only counted once.
    --  That is, if the answer has two queens and the guess has one,
    --  the correct ranks number would be 1, not 2. Likewise if there is one queen in the answer and two in the guess.

-- How many cards in the answer have rank higher than the highest rank in the guess(higher ranks).

-- How many of the cards in the answer have the same suit as a card in the guess,
    --  only counting a card in the guess once (correct suits).
    -- For example, if the answer has two clubs and the guess has one club,
    --  or vice versa, the correct suits number would be 1, not 2.
